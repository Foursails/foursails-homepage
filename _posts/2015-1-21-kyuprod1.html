<p>Dev,</p>

<p>I see you've gotten started on the project. You've thought about the overall architecture, jotted down a road map, initialized some GitHub repositories, and even set up a Dev Blog. Great work.</p>

<p>A few notes. First, I know you love to code, but you can't wait until the end of the project to figure out if your code even works. The guys upstairs released some notes, and they really want you getting this in front of players as soon as possible. That means getting into the client-side portion before the server-side. We'll worry about a secure backend later--if there's time.</p>

<p>Also, the guys upstairs love that you've made a roadmap, but they want something a bit more concrete timewise. We're going to need specific, weekly milestones for the duration of the project. We're gunna aim for 6 milestones from start to finish. We'll do a quick follow up every Wednesday, after we get word from the guys upstairs, to track progress on each milestone and adjust accordingly. Our tentative schedeule is as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Client layout: Get a web app up and running with a board, cards, etc. Doesn't have to do anything.</li>
	<li>Client interactivity: Have that web app interact. Maybe move the cards onto the board. Doesn't have to follow rules.</li>
	<li>Client gameplay: Have the web app start using the game library, even if the library gives wrong results.</li>
	<li>Library basics: Have the library handle all core game tasks. Start a game, determine play results, declare a winner and end.</li>
	<li>Library extras: Add some extra features to the library. Maybe create an AI, maybe add additional rules.</li>
	<li>Server lgoic: We'll see how we're doing with time at this point, and whether we want to make this a cloud-based game.</li>
</ol>

<p>Other than that, great work. I'm looking forward to making some progress and seeing some cards and a board by next week.</p>
